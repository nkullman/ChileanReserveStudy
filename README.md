About this repository:
-----
For background about why this data exists and what we're seeking to accomplish, see publication by T. Walter, N.Kullman, S. Toth, G. Ettl (manuscript in preparation, expected 2015).

CPLEX results from model described in above publication pre-scurbbed for dominated solutions and compiled into FrontierSolutions_SolnYearID.csv.

Turned into viz-friendly format using ChileanReserve_DataScrubbing_Frontier4_InteriorPts.py.

# ChileanReserveStudy

This repository exists to perform post-CPLEX data processing. For this particular project, we start with the CSV file FrontierSolutions_SolnYearID.csv and transform it into a more viz-friendly structure using ChileanReserve_DataScrubbing_Frontier4_InteriorPts.py.

For background about why this data exists and what we're seeking to accomplish, see publication by T. Walter, N.Kullman, S. Toth, G. Ettl (manuscript in preparation, expected 2015).
